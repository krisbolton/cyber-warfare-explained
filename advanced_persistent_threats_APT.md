# Chapter Introduction

This chapter brings together information on a significant number of APTs from publicly available reports and academic journals to provide an overview of the actions of APTs, their capabilities, targets and motivations.

The primary sources for this information are private cyber security companies; this creates specific concerns which are discussed below.

### Sources and Attribution

The reader should be critical and adopt healthy scepticism of all reports and articles discussing Advanced Persistent Threats, in particular when they discuss attribution.

APT detection, prevention and incident response is conducted by private companies and is not performed within an independent or academic environment. Further, the media's appetite for sensationalist headlines and stories of nation-backed cyber attacks create negative incentives for the writers of reports and those making decisions about attribution. Finally, company reports may be influenced by ignorance of the geopolitical landscape. Private sector security analysts are not privy to intelligence briefings and are not experts on the specifics of regional and global political and military events and thinking.

### APT Naming Conventions

Reading about APTs can be confusing due to the lack of an agreed naming convention used by all cyber security companies. Threat actors have different names, following conventions used within individual companies. For example, a particular Chinese APT is referred to by four names; APT1, Comment Crew, Comment Panda or The Shanghai Group. This is typical of all APTs.

All threat actors are listed with all of their names in this chapter, they are primarily referred to by the first name coined for each group or campaign.

### What is a Threat Actor?

It is worth pointing out the process by which a threat actor would be considered a different threat actor. Distinctions are made in regards to their operating principles and methodologies, technologies used, motive, targets and location (within a specific country). For example, an actor from northern China is likely to be a different group to a threat actor in southern China. However, they may be the same actor who has been incorrectly identified because they started a new campaign, changed methodologies or are part of a distributed team. It is this inherent uncertainty that means attribution is measured in degrees of confidence, rather than absolute statements.

# Overview of APT Targets

Advanced threat actors target entities for a varity of reasons; to gather intelligence, to gather intelligence on individuals, to further or protect the interests of the state, to conduct espionage, to steal techonolgy, or to disrupt or damage. To date, APT groups have targeted the following sectors within economies; [FILL].

# List of APTs

Only countries who's offensive cyber activities have been discovered are included here. If you believe there is an omission please <a href="mailto:cyberwarfareexplained@gmail.com">get in touch</a>. *Last updated: Jan 2020.*

# China

China is one of the most well-known threat actors by the general public, this is driven by the history of multiple campaigns attributed to China over the years. They are the largest threat actor by number of APT actors.

## Comment Crew

__a.k.a APT1, Comment Panda, The Shanghai Group, Byzantine Condor.__

The Comment Crew were the first APT to be directly attributed to a nation state due to significant circumstancial evidence discovered by Mandiant<sup>1</sup> (aquired by FireEye) and later confirmed by the FBI<sup>2</sup>. McAfee first <a href="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/technology/mcafee_shadyrat_report.pdf">reported</a><sup>3</sup><sup>‡</sup> their existance in 2007 as part of a report detailing their four-year campaign using the trojan ShadyRAT (Remote Access Trojan). In the period 2007-2011 McAfee identified 72 instances of the trojan, with 32 unique organisation categories located in 14 countries across the globe, most instances were discovered in the United States. The McAfee report includes more detail on targets and timelines of intrusion discovery.

Designated 'APT1' by Mandiant, the group was attributed to Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army through circumstantial evidence collected during investigations and open-source intelligence gathering. The <a href="https://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/services/pdfs/mandiant-apt1-report.pdf">Madiant report (PDF)</a> includes technical details, probable locations from which the attacks where conducted and the suspected identities of a number of the groups' members, the identities were later confirmed by the FBI<sup>2</sup>. The significant and intriguing information, partially confirmed by the FBI, lead to significant media interest and marks the beginning of the West viewing China as a sophisticated Cyber actor.
