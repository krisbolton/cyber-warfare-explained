This page describes the reasons which would prevent you from becoming a Sponsor.

## Exclusions

An individual or business is not eligible to become a Sponsor, or an active sponsorship will be terminated at any time without notice, if:

<ol>
    <li>the Sponsors actions are contrary to the spirit of the aims of Cyber Warfare Explained;</li>
    <li>the Sponsors actions are or could be considered harmful to the perception of Cyber Warfare Explained;</li>
    <li>the Sponsor actions do or could bring itself or Cyber Warfare Explained into disrepute.</li>
</ol>

### Brief Explanation

These exclusions aim to protect the neutral perception of Cyber Warfare Explained. For example, readers may assume a sponsor who consistently blames a specific country for cyber attacks holds bias against this nation, and uses financial influence to skew the neutrality of Cyber Warfare Explained to reflect their views of this nation.
