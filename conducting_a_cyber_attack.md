# Chapter Introduction

This chapter discusses part of the why nations conduct offensive cyber operations through the discussion of  scenario based attacks which a threat actor may conduct against a target.

# Why Nations Conduct Cyber Operations

The first obstacle to individuals understanding cyber warfare is why; "why would they do that?". We cannot cover the all of the reasons nations conduct cyber operations, this would require an enitre book to itself. This sub-section describes the main motivation - advantage - however, we will explore some of the numerous motivations through historical and future scenarios. 

Individuals are rarely privy to the intricacy and often tit-for-tat nature of international politics and diplomacy. Put simply, if there is an advantage to be gained nations may take action which leverages or creates that advantage. If you, dear reader, have been involved in a negotiation you will have some idea of the complexity and issues involved. Consider the process of selling a property, likely the closest thing most will come to this kind of complexity. Layers of bureaucracy designed to protect both parties; lawyers and solicitors, surveyors, estate agents and mortgage brokers. That mould the seller doesn't tell the buyer about, the structural imperfection the surveyor misses, all the money on lawyers, buyers complain about the seller, sellers complain about the buyer and both about the process. Months later, the transaction finally happens. Not disclosing issues is to the advantage of the seller, they materially gained while the buyer loses. Equally, the buyer is trying to obtain the advantage - the best price - ideally below market value.

State vs state interaction has complexity on a much greater scale, with multiple departments each with tens of thousands of civil servants working together and internationally. When wondering why a nation may conduct an action within the realm of cyber warfare, the first consideration is does it provide an advantage in any form? The intricacies around this simple question will be explored in the scenarios below.

# Planning an Attack

Attack orders are unlikely to come from Presidents, Prime Ministers or Chancellors, except in times of crisis (US-Iran drone retaliation). Cyber warfare is a day-to-day activity for national Militaries, Government organisations and state-affiliated organisations, such as Unit 61398 of the People Liberation Amry (PLA), Cyber Command (US), Strategic Command (UK)(formerly Joint Forces Command), or a private-state collaberation as seen with [NAME].

'Advanced' threat actors follow a similar attack method to typical <a href="">"black hat"</a> hackers, the major differences are the cyclical nature of the attack, the level of skill (advanced) which is due to the size of the organisation behind the attack and the sustained motivation (persistence) of the attackers. Hence the acrynm often used to describe state and state-sponsored actors, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

# Historic Scenarios
Scenarios from recent history.
## Scenario One
### An Industrial Target


Steal designs
Disrupt
Retribution


## Scenario Two
### A Telecoms Target

Steal subscriber information
Target individual
Build database


## Scenario Three
### Broad Target(s)

Shotgun approach, WannaCry


# Future Scenarios
Example scenarios exploring possible future actions.
## Scenario Four
### A Military Target


Disruption
Domination


## Scenario Five
### Farming?

At first glance, Farming may appear to be immune from the issues surrounding cyber security. Upon closer inspection, farming represents a high impact (strategic and economic) target with significant use of technology at every level of production and supply. However, this scenario will not focus on the more obvious technology exploitation and will instead explore the manipulation of public opinion through computational propoganda. This type of 'attack' appears unlikely and incomprehensible to the public being manipulated would find this difficult to beleive. The more a campaign is reminicent of a conspiracy theory, the more operational protection it is afforded by a cloak of confusion and deniability. The public, often a pressure on politicans - the tools that are often required to take action at a national level - are unaware, unsure or deny, security services are slowed attempting to desern what is real and what is not,.

# Shared Tools and Services?

Threat actors regularly share tools, not because they are in contact, but by the nature of the internet, open source community and programming culture.
