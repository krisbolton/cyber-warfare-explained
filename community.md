## GitHub Sponsors

Cyber War Explained aims to improve understanding of cyber warfare, by exploring recent history and explaining tactics, techniques and procedures of threat actors, among other things, while avoiding the usual hyperbole and misrepresentation of a complex subject. I can do this with the help of readers like you.

Research, academic books and referencing are expensive and time-consuming. I would like to add animation, interactive visuals and graphics to better explain concepts and historical attacks. Eventually, as more theoretical material is complete, I will use my technical background to create more technical content, for example walkthroughs of attack techniques used in historical attacks. 

Cyber War Explained is add-free, privacy-focused and uses technologies which ensure the user expeirence is excellent; non-tracking privacy-first analytics (Plausible,io), Content Delivery Network (CND) and more, in addition to the effort of the creator. At a minimum your sponsorship helps pay the bills. As time goes by I hope your combined sponsorship allows me to dedicate more time to the project and make Cyber War Explained an exceptional resource.

Sponsorship starts at $5/mo. Sponsors get accesss to a private Discord for discussion, content previews, Q&A and to vote on which content comes next. You will gain access to all previous discussions and Q&A.
